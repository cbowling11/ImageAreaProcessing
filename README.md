# ImageAreaProcessing

This is the first attempt of creating a program that can take an image of a grade/driveway/raod and calculate
an area in square footage. With a reference object size known we can accuratly estimate the boundaries of an area, 
the pixel length of the boundaries will be converted into feet and the distances will be used to calculate a square footage.
If desired, an option to convert to cubic yardage if a depth is given.
